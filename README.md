# Mohamed Izad – Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site is a single‑page black and white themed portfolio that introduces who I am, describes my work experience and research projects, provides a teaser for my blog, and shares contact details.

## Features

- **Responsive single‑page layout** with smooth scrolling navigation.
- **Fixed navigation bar** that highlights the current section as you scroll.
- **Hero section** with an abstract, geometric background image in black and white.
- **About** section summarising my background, skills and professional profile.
- **Work** section detailing my current role, research projects, education, and awards.
- **Blog** teaser area (content coming soon).
- **Contact** section with email, phone and location details.
